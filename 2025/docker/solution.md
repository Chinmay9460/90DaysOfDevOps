Describing Key terms --> 
    1.) Images -->  
            an image is a read-only template containing instructions for creating  
            container, essentially a blueprint for a running application env wit all its
            dependencies.
        What they are --> 
            Docker images are like snapshots or blueprints of a container's env including
            the application, libraries, and dependencies needed for it to run.

            Purpose --> 
                Images are built using Dockerfile, a text file containing instructions for
                building the image.
            
            Storage -->
                Docker images are stored in a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub.

    2.) Container --> 
            A Docker container is a running instance of an image. It is an isolated
            , lightweight, and portable execution env.

            .) Containers share the host OS kernel but have their own filesystem, network,
            and processes.
            .) You can create, start, stop, restart, and remove containers using 
                "docker run", ""docker stop", etc.
            
            -->$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx 
            This starts nginx server in detached mode(-d) and maps port 8080 on the host
            to port 80 in the container.

    **VIP 3.)Dockerfile -->
            A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set opf instructions to build a
            Docker image.

            .) Common directives --> 
                    FROM --> Specifies the base image(e.g., FROM ubuntu:latest)
                    RUN --> Executes commands duing image creation(e.g., RUN apt-get update)
                    
                    COPY --> Copies files from host to container(e.g., COPY . /app).
                    CMD or ENTRYPOINT --> Specifies the command to run when a container starts.


Example of a Dockerfile ::

    FROM node:16  
    WORKDIR /app  
    COPY . .  
    RUN npm install  
    CMD ["node", "server.js"]  
The DOckerfile sets up a Node.js env, installs dependencies and run server.js.

        
        4.) Volume --> 
            .) A Docker volume is a way to persist data generated by and used by 
            docker containers.
            Unlike the container's internal storage, volumes persist even after 
            the containers is removed. 
            
            .) Useful for database storage, application logs, and shared files b/w
                Containers.

Example of Volumes --> 
            docker volume create mydata
            docker run -v mydata:/var/lib.mysql -d mysql
This mounts the mydata volume to store MySQL database files.


        5.) Network --> 
            Docker networking allows comms b/w containers,
             the host system, and external networks.
            
            .) Default network types --> 
                .) bridge --> default for standalone containers
                    (docker network create my_bridge).
                .) host --> Uses the host machine's network stack.
                .) overlay --> Used for multi-host Swarm services.
                .) none --> No network access.

Example of netowrk --> 
            docker network create my_network
            docker run --network=my_network my_app
This connects the my_app container to a custom my_network.


1. Docker Engine
ðŸ›  The core runtime that runs and manages containers.
    It includes:
        Docker Daemon (dockerd) â†’ Runs in the background, manages containers, images, volumes, and networks.
        REST API â†’ Allows communication with Docker Daemon using commands.

        Docker CLI (docker) â†’ Command-line tool for interacting with Docker.
    Example:
            docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
    The CLI sends the command to the Docker Daemon, which pulls the Nginx image 
    (if not available) and runs a container.
