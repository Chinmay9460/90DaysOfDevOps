Feature 	        Virtualization (VMs)	                            Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
Isolation	   Full OS-level isolation (Hypervisor + Guest OS)	   Process-level isolation (Shared host OS kernel)
Performance	   Slower (VM boot time, resource overhead)	           Near-native speed (Lightweight, minimal overhead)
Resource Usage	 High (Each VM runs a full OS)	                          Low (Containers share the host OS)
Startup Time	         Minutes	                                                  Seconds
Portability	    Limited (Large VM images, OS-dependent)	                  Highly portable (Runs anywhere with Docker)
Scaling	          Slow (Requires new VMs)	                              Instant (Spin up containers dynamically)
Security	       Strong (Full isolation)	                                Good (Depends on kernel security)
Use Case	Legacy apps, full OS needs	                                 Microservices, cloud-native apps, DevOps
